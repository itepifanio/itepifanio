Hello World! 👋

I'm Ítalo Epifânio, a passionate R&D Python Developer at Palaimon GmbH, where I'm deeply engaged in developing innovative AI/ML products. With a rich background in software engineering and computer science, I specialize in Python and data-driven technologies.

🎓 Educated in Computer Science with a decade of technology education, I started programming at 15 and haven't stopped exploring new frontiers in tech. My expertise spans full-stack development, AI, and machine learning, with a keen interest in MLOps.

📈 As a versatile developer, I have experience in web development (PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, SQL and NoSQL databases) and a strong focus on AI, particularly in computer vision.

🌍 Community engagement is at the heart of my journey. I actively contribute to the Python community through organizing events, giving talks, open-source contributions, and supporting newcomers.
